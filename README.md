# Data Structures and Algorithm Challenges 🚀

Welcome to my repository where I tackle various data structures and algorithm problems, primarily sourced from LeetCode. The primary goal of this project is to enhance my understanding and implementation skills of different data structures and algorithms.

## Project Structure 📁

This project is organized by individual problem directories, each containing TypeScript implementations and solutions.

## Goals 🎯

- **Learn Data Structures**: Implement and understand various data structures such as arrays, linked lists, and dynamic arrays.
- **Solve LeetCode Problems**: Practice and solve as many LeetCode problems as possible to strengthen problem-solving skills.

## Getting Started 🚀

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 🌐
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) 📘

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
  ```bash
  npm install
  ```
3. Compile the TypeScript files:
  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```
### Running the Code 🏃‍♂️
After compiling the TypeScript files, you can run the JavaScript output located in the dist directory. For example, to run the solution for the "Remove Element" problem:

  ```bash
  node dist/RemoveElement/index.js
  ```
### Debugging 🐞
With source maps enabled, you can debug your TypeScript code using a debugger that supports source maps, such as Visual Studio Code or Chrome DevTools.

### Contribution 🤝
